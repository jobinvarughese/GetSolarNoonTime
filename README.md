# GetSolarNoonTime
Getting Solar Noon times of the day, when you have the date and LatLong of the place
#Bird behaviour are almost always bimodal in their activity peaks in a day. Time data for behaviour can thus be converted based on Solar Noon, Solar Dusk or Solar Dawn times. 
#But procuring data for these times, across a large dataset of several spatial and temporal replicates can be difficult.
#Package suncalc to the rescue
